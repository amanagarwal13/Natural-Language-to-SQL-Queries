 Create a user-friendly Natural Language (NL) to Structured Query Language (SQL) tool to empower non-technical IRS officers with the ability to access and retrieve results from the financial database. The tool aimed to bridge the gap between the technical complexities of writing accurate SQL queries and the non-technical background of the end-users. By developing this tool, the project sought to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of data retrieval processes, enabling IRS officers to make data-driven decisions with ease.
